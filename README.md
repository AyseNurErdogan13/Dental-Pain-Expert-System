# Dental Pain Expert System
 With this application, using the expert systems structure, the rules determined for toothache and solutions were given in response to these rules, and decisions were made in line with these rules.
 
## Rules and Solutions

The following rules and corresponding solutions are used in this expert system:

- If there is bleeding in the gums while brushing teeth, there is a dental disease and the dentist should be consulted.
- If there is prolonged bleeding in the gums while brushing teeth, there is gum recession and the dentist should be consulted.
- If there is gum recession and the root of the tooth is visible, filling should be done.
- If there is discoloration caused by food and drinks on the tooth, the teeth should be cleaned.
- If there is bruising when a new tooth is coming in, the dentist should be consulted.
- If there is decay in the tooth that does not cause pain, filling should be done.
- If the tooth decay is advanced, root canal treatment and filling should be done.
